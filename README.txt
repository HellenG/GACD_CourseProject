Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
===========================================

This repo was created as a requirement for one of the nine Data Science Courses i.e. Getting and Cleaning Data.

In the repo are two scripts, one is an R file called 'run_analysis' and a markdown file called 'CodeBook'. The R file contains code for producing a tidy dataset while the CodeBook file gives a small description of the data used to generate the R script. It also details the transformation carried out and the variables in the tidy dataset.
